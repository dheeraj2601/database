How to choose the right type of database for your enterprise


Relational database management systems (Oracle, MySQL, MS Server, PostgreSQL)
Situations where data integrity is absolutely paramount (i.e., for financial applications, defense and security, and private health information)
Highly structured data
Automation of internal processes


Document store (MongoDB, Couchbase)
Unstructured or semistructured data
Content management
In-depth data analysis
Rapid prototyping


Key-value store (Redis, Memcached)
Recommendations
User profiles and settings
Unstructured data such as product reviews or blog comments
Session management at scale
Data that will be accessed frequently but not often updated


Wide-column store (Cassandra, HBase)
Use a wide-column store for:
Big data analytics where speed is important
Data warehousing on big data
Large scale projects (this database style is not a good tool for average transactional applications)


Search engine (Elasticsearch)
Improving user experience with faster search results
Logging

Lightweight
sqlite
